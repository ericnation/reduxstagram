# Learn Redux

A simple React + Redux app I made in order to learn Redux. This was built through a course I took from Wes Bos called [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com/)

App can be viewed at [https://learn-redux-oyufdgfvls.now.sh/](https://learn-redux-oyufdgfvls.now.sh/)

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies.

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
